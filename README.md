# Cal2SMS

A project I worked on a few weeks ago to assist a friend. The intention was to read data from google calendar, and then send data relevant to specific individuals. While I completed the initial aspect of the project (pulling the events from google calendar), I did not get to complete the latter half (sending out the contents as SMS) as the requestor was content with doing that manually.
